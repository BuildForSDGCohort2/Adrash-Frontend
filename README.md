## Introduction

<p>
Ethiopia is one of the developing countries in Africa. The capital is Addis Ababa and the seat of the African Union as well as other international offices. As a result, many foreigners come. The city is growing and the population is large, including people from abroad and from the region.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Most people in the city have access to public transportation. It is difficult to know which taxi and where to book to move, especially for someone new to the city. Google Map and other similar apps could not solve this problem, so we had to make this application work.
